Welcome to Maxwell's Demon!

The game contains four files, Fun.java, Ball.java, Red_Ball.java, Blue_Ball.java.
Red_Ball and Blue_Ball are inherited classes of Ball class.
The Fun class contains main() to start.
Please compile all the classes and run Fun.java!

Sadly, there are no special features in this game due to the repercussions of the Coronoa Virus.

Thanks for playing the game and have a great summer vacation!
